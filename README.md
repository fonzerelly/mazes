== Mazes ==

This is an implementation of mazes based on the book of Jamis Buck [Mazes for Programmers](http://www.mazesforprogrammers.com/).
But instead of Ruby and Objectorientation, this implementation prefers JavaScript and
Functional Programming.

Until now only the BinaryTree-Algorithm is implemented. Run it with npm start to get a 5x5 Grid.
Call it with
```
node bin/render_binary_tree_maze.js <rows> <cols>
```

Run the test suite with npm test.
